Spam URLs are unwanted or unsolicited URLs that are sent to users via email, text, or other online platforms. Spam URLs may contain malware, viruses, or scams that can harm the userâ€™s device or data. Identifying spam URLs is a difficult task, as they often use deceptive techniques to appear legitimate and bypass spam filters.
In this project, we propose a neural networks approach to classify URLs as spam or non-spam based on their features. We use a dataset of labeled URLs from Scamvoid and SiteGuarding, and extract features from the URL strings and domains. 
We evaluate the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics and find out the best model. We also test the models on new URLs and check for false positives or false negatives.
