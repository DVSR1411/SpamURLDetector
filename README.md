# Spam URL Detector

Spam URLs are unwanted or unsolicited URLs that are sent to users via email, text, or other online platforms. They may contain malware, viruses, or scams that can harm the user‚Äôs device or data. Identifying spam URLs is a challenging task due to their deceptive techniques to appear legitimate and bypass spam filters.

This project proposes a neural networks approach to classify URLs as spam or non-spam based on their features. We utilize a dataset of labeled URLs from Scamvoid and SiteGuarding, extracting features from the URL strings and domains. We evaluate the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to determine the best model. Additionally, we test the models on new URLs to check for false positives or false negatives.

## Dataset

We use a curated dataset of labeled URLs from Scamvoid and SiteGuarding, containing examples of both spam and non-spam URLs.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: We preprocess the URLs to extract relevant features such as domain, path length, presence of special characters, etc.
  
2. **Neural Network Architecture**: We design a neural network architecture suitable for URL classification, considering features extracted from the URLs.
  
3. **Model Training**: We train the neural network on the labeled dataset, optimizing it for accuracy and generalization.
  
4. **Model Evaluation**: We evaluate the trained model using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a test dataset.
  
5. **Testing on New URLs**: We test the trained model on new URLs to identify any false positives or false negatives.

## Results

The results of our experiments indicate the effectiveness of the neural networks approach in classifying spam URLs. We achieve competitive performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage

To use the spam URL classifier:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Preprocess your dataset or URLs to extract features.
4. Train the neural network model using the provided scripts.
5. Evaluate the trained model on test data.
6. Test the model on new URLs and analyze the results.

## Conclusion

The neural networks approach shows promise in effectively classifying spam URLs, providing a valuable tool for enhancing online security and combating cyber threats.
